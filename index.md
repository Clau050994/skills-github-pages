## My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **TechBridge**:In the digital era, possessing a device transcends luxury—it's often a necessity. Yet, not everyone is in a position to own one. TechBridge is an initiative where those in need can narrate their stories, illustrating their device requirements. Donors, inspired by these stories, can then step in to make a pivotal difference. https://replit.com/@clau050994/CVaronaAdvocacyProject
- **JavaCS7E-Solutions**: This repository contains my personal solutions to the programming exercises found in the textbook "Java: Control Structures through Objects, 7th Edition". Each chapter in the book corresponds to a directory in this repository, where individual solutions are organized by exercise number. https://github.com/Clau050994/JavaCS7E-Solutions
